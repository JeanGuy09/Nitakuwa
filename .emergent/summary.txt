<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack career platform, KONGENGA, for the Democratic Republic of Congo. The development followed a phased approach: initial analysis and clarification, then a comprehensive frontend-only implementation using mock data, followed by backend development to establish database models, authentication, and CRUD APIs. The engineer consistently addressed user feedback regarding design iterations (from pink/magenta to dark animated, then to blue themes, and specific background image requests) and backend stability (fixing import errors, resolving a favorites issue). The work is currently focused on implementing precise UI design adjustments, specifically gradient blue elements.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build KONGENGA, a career platform for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Users should be able to select jobs from various sectors, view detailed job information (studies, salaries, companies, testimonials, online training), and interact with features like saving favorite job offers and tracking progress. The application targets students. A key requirement is a site manager profile to easily modify realistic fictitious data specific to DRC sectors. Design specifications include a modern aesthetic with animations, depth, bold typography, confident color use, and asymmetry. Initially, the design was based on a pink/magenta brand, then shifted to a dark gradient background with animated elements, and most recently, to a blue-themed design, with specific requests for African/DRC-themed background images and gradient blue elements like a slide bar. The application must support French, with future translation to Lingala, Swahili, English, and Kikongo. External links for companies and training should be integrated.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Environment Setup**: Dockerized environment, Supervisor for process management, Kubernetes Ingress rules for API routing ( prefix).
-   **Frontend**: React Router for navigation, Axios for API calls, Tailwind CSS for styling, Shadcn UI components for UI elements,  for notifications, Context APIs for Auth and Language.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI for RESTful APIs, Motor for async MongoDB client, Pydantic for data models, JWT for authentication.
-   **Development Workflow**: Frontend-first with mock data, then backend integration, iterative testing.
-   **Design Principles**: Emphasis on micro-animations, layering, bold typography, vibrant colors, asymmetrical layouts, and performance.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a  directory for the React application and a  directory for the FastAPI application.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : Initially created to house all mock data for the frontend-only version, including job opportunities, companies, universities, salaries, and testimonials. This enabled rapid prototyping and user feedback before backend integration.
*   : Configures React Router for navigation (, , ). Initially had a simple  route. Later modified to include  and  providers, and to integrate the various pages like , , , , , , , . It also handles basic API health checks using Axios and .
*   : Numerous components were created to build out the UI.
    *   : The landing page, significantly updated multiple times for design changes (pink/magenta, dark animated, blue theme, background images).
    *   : Navigation bar, also subject to frequent design updates for branding and color schemes.
    *   : Displays job sectors, updated to reflect design changes (dark theme, blue theme).
    *   : Displays detailed job information.
    *   , : Authentication forms.
    *   , , : User-specific functionalities.
*   : The main FastAPI application. Configured with  for cross-origin requests. It includes  for all API routes prefixed with . It defines initial  models and endpoints and was later expanded to include routers for various entities.
*   : Defines Pydantic models for MongoDB data structures (e.g., User, Job, Sector, Company, Testimonial, Training). This forms the schema for the database.
*   : Handles MongoDB connection using .
*   : Likely contains scripts or definitions for generating realistic fictitious data for the MongoDB database, reflecting the DRC context.
*   : Implements authentication logic, including JWT token generation and verification. Subject to fixes for import issues.
*   : A modular structure for API endpoints, with separate files for , , , , , , , and . This promotes code organization and maintainability.
*   : Provides authentication context to the React application, managing user login state and tokens.
*   : Provides context for language selection, supporting the multilingual requirement.
*   : Centralized file for all API calls from the frontend to the backend, abstracting Axios requests and using .
*    and : Define the global Tailwind CSS styles and configuration, including custom color palettes and animations, heavily used for implementing the design guidelines.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of multilingual support beyond French to Lingala, Swahili, English, and Kikongo.
-   Integration of specific African/DRC-themed background images (fauna, flora, youth, Kinshasa, heroes) as requested, which might require image selection.
-   Applying a gradient blue design to the slide bar element.

<current_work>
The application, KONGENGA, is a full-stack career platform for the DRC. The frontend, built with React and Tailwind CSS, is comprehensive, including a Homepage, job Sector and Detail pages, user Authentication (Login/Register), Dashboard, Favorites, and an Admin Panel. Initially, it used mock data, but the backend, built with FastAPI and MongoDB, has now been implemented and integrated. The backend includes models and API endpoints for users, authentication, sectors, jobs, companies, training, testimonials, and administrative functions. Core authentication and CRUD operations are largely functional, with a recent fix applied to the favorites system.

The current focus is on refining the UI design based on recent user feedback. The application has transitioned through several design iterations: from an initial pink/magenta scheme to a dark, animated theme with gradient backgrounds. Most recently, the user requested a return to a previous design but with blue and specified the use of yellow, blue, and red colors with background images representing Africa/DRC. The AI engineer has updated , , and  to incorporate the blue theme and other design elements. Linting issues encountered during these design updates were promptly fixed. The application has basic multilingual support in French. The last instruction was to make the slide bar gradient blue.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the gradient blue design for the slide bar as per the latest user request.
